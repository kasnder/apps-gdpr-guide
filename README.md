# An App Developer's Guide to GDPR

My MSc thesis in Computer Science, supervised by Max van Kleek (University of Oxford), analysed a large range of documents, that an app
developer must consider for data protection under GDPR.
This analysis resulted in a set of developer guidelines.

These guidelines are shared, in the hope that some app developers might find them useful.
Instead of providing a lengthly legal document, these guidelines represent the *personal view of an app developer*.
They are by no means exhaustive, complete, nor proven in court.
Please don't sue me.

## Download

**Download the guidelines [as pdf](https://gdpr4devs.com/guidelines.pdf) or visit [the website](https://gdpr4devs.com/).**

The guidelines comprise 2 pages, and an appendix on third-party services.

## Self-Certification

To signify compliance with these guidelines, an app developer may use the [provided logo](https://github.com/kasnder/app-dev-privacy-guidelines/blob/master/certification/certificate.png).

## Methodology

The developer guidelines shall cover the fundamentals of GDPR. These are 1) the key concepts, 2)
user rights, and 3) principles and obligations.

In addition, the
specific data protection requirements of the most popular third-party services shall be included.

Legal terminology shall be avoided, to make
the guidelines understandable without expert knowledge.

### Key concepts

The app developer shall be made aware of what GDPR protects, that is,
*personal data*. Personal data is relevant for the developer, being
responsible for its protection as the *data controller*.

There has been
much public attention on the *high penalties*, introduced by GDPR. The
risk of such penalties is low, if the developer follows a *risk-based
approach* to data protection, as advocated by GDPR.

### User rights

Not all developers will be aware of the profound rights, that GDPR
grants to users.
These shall be mentioned.

### Principles and obligations

The rest of the document shall cover the seven principles of GDPR, that
the developer must follow as data controller:

-   Lawfulness, fairness and transparency,
-   Purpose limitation,
-   Data minimisation,
-   Accuracy,
-   Storage limitation,
-   Security, and
-   Accountability.

To cover the first principle, “lawfulness, fairness and transparency”,
the most important step is the provision of an adequate *privacy
policy*. There exist rich online resources, which shall be mentioned.

For simplicity, the principles “purpose limitation”, “data
minimisation”, “accuracy”, and “storage limitation” shall be summarised
as *reasonable data collection*.
The term “reasonable” is similarly used
in the GDPR and occurs widely across the GDPR document, 52 times.

Regarding data collection, the further provisions of the platform
providers, Apple and Google, shall be added.

The remaining principles of “security” and “accountability” shall be
mentioned.
Regarding security, Apple and Google provide support
documents, that shall be linked.

        <p style="color:gray; font-size: 80%; text-align: center;"><strong>This is no legal advice, but only an app developer’s endeavour to make data protection more approachable.</strong></p>

<p>If you have app users from the European Union, you are responsible for
all personal data collected through your app. Personal data means all
data that relates to individuals. This may even include user identifiers
and IP addresses. Also “anonymous” data or device data can qualify as
personal data, if it can be related to individuals, and you must protect
it. You are responsible for any personal data collected on behalf of
third-parties, such as advertising, analytics, or crash reporting
services.</p>

<p><strong>Risk evaluation and record keeping.</strong>
GDPR acknowledges that there
will never be full protection of personal data. Instead, it encourages a
risk-based approach, that is, seriously analysing the possible risks to
data protection. If you can prove that you took all reasonable measures,
there is no need to be overly afraid of high penalties. Make sure that
you can provide such proof, by <em>keeping records of all data protection
considerations and actions</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Handling user requests.</strong>
The GDPR entitles users to manage (e.g.
access, delete, correct) any data about them. You can implement these
user rights directly in software, which would show your efforts towards
GDPR compliance. Yet, taking requests via email seriously is just as
fine. You have one month to respond to user requests.</p>

<p><strong>Reasonable data collection.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You and your third-parties may only collect personal data
reasonably, that is, restricted to what is necessary for service
provision.</li>
  <li><em>iOS:</em> Always ask for user consent, before you or your third-parties
collect <em>any data</em>, even if not related to the user.<br />
<em>Android:</em> If you process sensitive data (e.g. health-related), or
process data in unexpected ways, do tell the user in a clear manner
and ask for his <em>consent</em> (no pre-ticked boxes allowed).</li>
  <li>At best, use at most one third-party service for one purpose, that
is, at most one advertising, analytics, and crash reporting service.</li>
  <li>Check with every app release, if you can remove any third-party
services.</li>
  <li>Verify the default settings of your third-party services (on-device
and server-wise), since third-parties have an interest in collecting
ever more data. Only activate third-party services, once user
consent is established.</li>
  <li>If your app is aimed at <em>children</em>, do not employ any third-party
services.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Always provide a privacy policy.</strong> Provide a privacy policy on the app
store and within the app. You may want to use one of the privacy policy
generators, such as <a href="iubenda.com">iubenda.com</a>. Make sure it discloses
the data collection of you and your third-parties adequately.</p>

<p><strong>Security measures and data breaches.</strong> Take the standard measures for
security, such as HTTPS communications, salted passwords, validation of
user inputs. Apple (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security">here</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/SecureCodingGuide">here</a>) and <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips">Google</a> provide comprehensive guidance
on this. Try to remove identifiable information whenever possible,
through pseudonymisation or anonymisation. If you experience a <em>personal
data breach</em>, you must notify <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members">the data protection authority</a>
within 72 hours, plus the individuals in case of high risk.</p>

<p><strong>Consent for third-party services.</strong> If you use third-party services,
the user must be asked for consent in almost all circumstances. This
consent must be sought before the third-party service is activated and
begins to share data. Beyond consent,
the Appendix below provides more detail on
the correct implementation of the most widely used third-party services.</p>

<p><strong>Closing remarks.</strong> By implementing these measures, you should come an
important step closer to compliance with GDPR. Additionally, you should
consult the guidelines of an EU data protection authority. The British
Data Protection Authority, called ICO, provides <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/">excellent guidance</a>
on data protection.</p>

<h3 id="adjust">Adjust</h3>
<p>Once the Adjust SDK is enabled in your app, data sharing takes place,
notably of device events. User consent should be established before
enabling this SDK. It stands out that Adjust integrates the GDPR <em>right
to deletion</em> into their SDK. This could be implemented in your app, to
show your efforts to comply with GDPR.</p>

<p><em>More info:</em>
<a href="https://github.com/adjust/sdks">https://github.com/adjust/sdks</a></p>

<h3 id="applovin">AppLovin</h3>
<p>For EU users, AppLovin requires consent to be passed on
programmatically. If consent is given, the Advertising ID and IP address
will be sent to advertising partners, otherwise only a country code.
Once loaded at runtime, AppLovin automatically receives the information
that the app was installed.</p>

<p><em>More info:</em>
<a href="https://www.applovin.com/gdprfaqs/">https://www.applovin.com/gdprfaqs/</a></p>

<h3 id="appsflyer">AppsFlyer</h3>
<p>The service collects the Advertising ID and a unique AppsFlyer user ID
from the first app start. User consent should be established before
activating this service. If the Advertising ID cannot be accessed,
permanent identifiers, notably the device’s IMEI, are shared with
AppsFlyer, unless programmatically disabled. Such permanent identifiers
are highly critical from a data protection standpoint. This practice
should be communicated transparently to the user, if not disabled.</p>

<h3 id="facebook-sdk">Facebook SDK</h3>
<p>From the first app start, the Facebook SDK collects device information
and events (app installation, app start, in-app purchases), unless
programmatically disabled. User consent should be established before
activating this SDK. Facebook serves no advertising, if the user limits
interest-based ads from the device settings.</p>

<a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/best-practices/gdpr-compliance">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/best-practices/gdpr-compliance</a></p>

<h3 id="flurry">Flurry</h3>
<p>For ads, this service provides a complicated mechanism to establish a
user consent. Since legally required for many advertising services, you
may want to consider easier, alternative approaches to establish valid
user consent. Unless programmatically disabled, the user location is
collected for analytics purposes, if the app has the permission to
retrieve such. This is highly invasive and may violate GDPR. At very
least, this practice should be disclosed to the user transparently, if
not disabled. Generally, user consent should be established before
activating this service.</p>

<h3 id="google-admob">Google AdMob</h3>
<p>This service serves personalised advertising by default, violating
Google’s policies if used in the EU. This must be changed by the
developer, such that user consent is established prior to serving
personalised ads. AdMob shares device statistics and events with Google
from the first app start, unless programmatically changed. User consent
should be established before activating this service.</p>

<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
<p>User opt-out and IP anonymisation are supported programmatically and
their implementation should be considered. User consent should be
established before using this service.</p>

<h3 id="google-chrashlytics">Google Chrashlytics</h3>
<p>This service shares crash reports with Google from the first app start,
unless changed by the developer. User consent should be established
before activating this service.</p>

<h3 id="google-doubleclick">Google DoubleClick</h3>
<p>This service serves personalised advertising by default, violating
Google’s policies if used in the EU. User consent should be established
before activating this service.</p>

<h3 id="google-firebase-analytics">Google Firebase Analytics</h3>
<p>This service collects device statistics from the first app start, unless
changed by the developer. The collected data includes the Google
Advertising ID, unless programmatically disabled, and may be used for
advertising purposes under certain circumstances. User consent should be
established before activating this service.</p>

<p><em>More info:</em>
<a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/configure-data-collection">https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/configure-data-collection</a></p>

<h3 id="inmobi">Inmobi</h3>
<p>The Inmobi SDK only collects personal data, if you explicitly indicate
to the SDK that user consent was established. If no consent is given,
unpersonalised ads are shown to the user. Inmobi encourages you to
provide data about location and demographics for higher revenue, if you
programmatically pass on this information. Such sensitive data
collection should be transparently disclosed to the user, if not
refrained from.</p>

<h3 id="mopub">MoPub</h3>
<p>For increased advertising revenue, MoPub shares data with two other
services, IAS and Moat, unless programmatically disabled. These services
must be transparently communicated to the user, if not disabled. User
consent should be established before activating this service.</p>

<h3 id="unity-ads">Unity Ads</h3>
<p>Unity automatically asks for user consent, unless a special arrangement
is reached with Unity. Personal data is only collected if the user
consents. When ads are served, Unity provides the user with a “privacy
icon”, to change his opt-out setting. If the user opts-out, all
collected data is deleted.</p>

<h1 id="background">Background</h1>

<p>My MSc thesis in Computer Science, supervised by Max van Kleek (University of Oxford), analysed a large range of documents, that an app
developer must consider for data protection under GDPR.
This analysis resulted in a set of developer guidelines.</p>

<p>These guidelines are shared, in the hope that some app developers might find them useful.
Instead of providing a lengthly legal document, these guidelines represent the <em>personal view of an app developer</em>.
They are by no means exaustive, complete, nor proven in court.
Please don’t sue me.</p>

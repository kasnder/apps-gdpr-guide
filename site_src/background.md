My MSc thesis in Computer Science, supervised by Max van Kleek (University of Oxford), analysed a large range of documents, that an app
developer must consider for data protection under GDPR.
This analysis resulted in a set of developer guidelines.

These guidelines are shared, in the hope that some app developers might find them useful.
Instead of providing a lengthly legal document, these guidelines represent the *personal view of an app developer*.
They are by no means exaustive, complete, nor proven in court.
Please don't sue me.
